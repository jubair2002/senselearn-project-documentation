# Problem Statement

## Educational Accessibility Challenges

Traditional learning management systems often fail to adequately address the needs of students with disabilities. This creates significant barriers to quality education and limits opportunities for inclusive learning experiences.

## Key Problems Identified

### 1. Limited Accessibility Features

Most existing learning platforms lack comprehensive accessibility features tailored to different disability types. Students with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments face difficulties in:

- Accessing course materials in formats suitable for their needs
- Navigating complex interfaces
- Engaging with content that doesn't accommodate assistive technologies
- Receiving personalized support based on their specific requirements

### 2. Inadequate Course Management

Educational institutions struggle with:

- Organizing courses based on disability-specific requirements
- Managing multiple tutors and their course assignments
- Tracking student enrollment and progress effectively
- Coordinating between administrators, tutors, and students

### 3. Lack of Personalized Learning Support

Students with disabilities often require:

- Immediate assistance when encountering difficulties
- Context-aware help based on their current course materials
- Alternative formats for content consumption (text-to-speech, etc.)
- Progress tracking that accounts for their learning pace

### 4. Security and User Management Issues

Existing systems face challenges with:

- Secure user authentication and authorization
- Tutor verification and credential management
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
